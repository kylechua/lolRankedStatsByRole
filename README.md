<h2>League of Legends - Role Stats (IN PROGRESS)</h2>

<p>
This service fetches a player's solo/duo ranked stats based on their role from the Riot API. This also fetches the player's total stats. Eventually, I plan to create a user interface for this project and run the queries from a third-party server.<br>
